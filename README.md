Credit Card Approval Project

Overview

The Credit Card Approval project is a machine learning application that predicts whether a credit card application should be approved or rejected based on applicant data. This project demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling in a real-world scenario.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and data normalization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes visualizations to understand patterns and relationships in the data.

Machine Learning Models: Implements and evaluates multiple models, such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forests..
Evaluation Metrics: Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.

Workflow

Data Collection:

The dataset contains features such as age, income, credit history, employment status, and others.

Data may be sourced from publicly available datasets or synthetic data generated for the project.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values using imputation methods (mean, median, or mode).

Convert categorical variables to numerical using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Normalize or standardize numerical features to improve model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the data distribution, correlations, and feature importance.

Identify key factors influencing credit card approval.

Model Training and Evaluation:

Train multiple machine learning models.

Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Evaluate models using a train-test split.

Prediction:

Use the best-performing model to predict whether a credit card application will be approved.
