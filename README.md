# Credit Card Approval Project

## Overview
The Credit Card Approval project is a machine,deep learning application that predicts whether a credit card application should be approved or rejected based on applicant data. This project demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling in a real-world scenario.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and data normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes visualizations to understand patterns and relationships in the data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements and evaluates multiple models, such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forests.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**:
   - The dataset contains features such as age, income, credit history, employment status, and others.
   - Data may be sourced from publicly available datasets or synthetic data generated for the project.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Convert categorical variables to numerical using label encoding.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize the data distribution, correlations, and feature importance.
   - Identify key factors influencing credit card approval.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Train multiple machine learning models.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
   - Evaluate models using a train-test split.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Use the best-performing model to predict whether a credit card application will be approved.
